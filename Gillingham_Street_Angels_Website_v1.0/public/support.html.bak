    <h2>Donating to Gillingham Street Angels</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our support is a lifeline for thousands of people in our community and
      surrounding areas, their families and pets. In these unprecedented times
      the Gillingham Street Angels are working hard to support the most
      vulnerable in our society, from our homeless, our young through to our
      older generation including pets, those who suffer from social isolation,
      or those who are simply overwhelmed by the challenges associated with the
      Covid-19 pandemic. We can only continue to provide these services with
      your help. Whether it’s a one-off donation or a regular gift, no donation
      is too small to make a difference, so please donate today.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Help us be there for more animals</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      We do everything we can to alleviate animal suffering or end up in rescue
      centres because families find that they can no longer afford to keep their
      beloved pet due to food costs or health care, we cannot support this
      alone. It’s the generosity of supporters like you who make it possible.
      You need to know that we strongly appreciate your support to, protect and
      care for animals in need.F
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>How your donations help</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      We provide support with food (for pets as well) and household goods for
      members of the Medway community, and surrounding areas. By making a
      donation, you’re helping us to help those in need within our community and
      further afield. We hope to reduce waste as much as possible and see
      everything distributed and re-used, to help people who may not have
      essential items like beds, storage for clothes, or a table to eat dinner
      from. There are a few decorative bits too, to cheer up your space as
      mental health means such a lot to us.
